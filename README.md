# PVE VDI Client

This project's focus is to create a simple VDI client intended for mass deployment. This VDI client connects directly to Proxmox VE and allows users to connect (via Spice) to any VMs they have permission to access.

If you need to customize the installation, such as to sign the executable and MSI, you may download and install the [WIX toolset](https://wixtoolset.org/releases/) and use the build_vdiclient.bat file to build a new MSI.

    cd ./PVE-VDIClient/
    chmod +x requirements.sh
    ./requirements.sh
    cp vdiclient.py /usr/local/bin

## Configuration File

PVE VDI Client **REQUIRES** a configuration file to function. The client searches for this file in the following locations unless **--config** is specified on the commmand line:

* Windows
    * %APPDATA%\VDIClient\vdiclient.ini
    * %PROGRAMFILES%\VDIClient\vdiclient.ini
* Linux
    * ~/.config/VDIClient/vdiclient.ini
    * /etc/vdiclient/vdiclient.ini
    * /usr/local/etc/vdiclient/vdiclient.ini

Please refer to **vdiclient.ini.example** for all available config file options

If you encounter any issues feel free to submit an issue report.

## Proxmox Permission Requirements

Users that are accessing VDI instances need to have the following permissions assigned for each VM they access:

* VM.PowerMgmt
* VM.Console
* VM.Audit
